//! # Optimath
//!
//! A Linear Algebra library that uses const generics to be no_std and specialization to enable SIMD*.
//!
//! *simd blocked on compiler bug, autovectorization works well though.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### Element-wise addition
//!
//!     use optimath::{Vector, Stupidity};
//!     use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
//!     let mut rng = thread_rng();
//!
//!     // Vectors can be initalized from an rng,
//!     let a: Vector<i32, 2000> = rng.gen();
//!     // from iterators
//!     let b: Vector<i32, 2000> = (0..2000).collect();
//!     // with an initalizer function
//!     let c: Vector<i32, 2000> = Vector::build_with_fn(|i| i as i32);
//!     // or using Default
//!     let d: Vector<i32, 2000> = Default::default();
//!
//!     let e = &a + &b;
//!     let f = &c + &d;
//!     let h = &e + &f;
//!
//! ### Matrix multiplication
//!
//!     use optimath::Matrix;
//!     let a: Matrix<f32, 2, 3> = Default::default();
//!     let b: Matrix<f32, 3, 4> = Default::default();
//!
//!     // matrix size is checked at compile time!
//!     let c: Matrix<f32, 2, 4> = a.matrix_multiply(&b);
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The whole library is built around just one type, [Vector<T, N>](Vector) representing a Vector of N
//! elements of type T.
//!
//! In case T supports some math operation like addition (implements the Add trait) the Vector too
//! supports that as an element-wise operation. As such a Vector<Vector<T: Add, N>, M> also
//! supports addition, due to Vector<T: Add, N> being a type that implements Add.
//!
//! Matrices and Tensors are therefore just Vectors within Vectors (within Vectors)
//!
//! ### no_std
//!
//! const generics are used to enable Vectors to contain any (fixed) number of elements and
//! therefore not require allocation on the heap.
//!
//! ### SIMD
//!
//! Vectors provide generic math operations for any T that implements that operation.
//! specialization is used to provide optimized implementations for specific T, like for example
//! floats and integers.
//!
//! At this moment SIMD support is disabled while we wait for rustc to fix some ICE :).
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! Besides being hopefully useful as a library it is also an exploration of rusts newer advanced
//! type system features. It is therefore an explicit goal to provide feedback to the developers of
//! those features. The [insights] module contains some of that.
//!
//! It is also meant to explore the design space of Linear Algebra libraries that utilize those
//! features. As such it may serve as inspiration for how bigger linalg libraries might adopt
//! them.
//!
//! ## Changelog (and future)
//!
//! ### 0.1.0
//! * A Vector type that can do element-wise maths
//! * Basic linear algebra operations
//! * A sturdy design for future improvements
//!
//! ### 0.2.0
//! * serde support
//! * rand support
//!
//! ### 0.3.0 (current)
//! * moved more iterating over to ConstIterator
//! * add templatemetamaths (building a calculation, then building the result element by element)
//!
//! ### 0.X.0
//! * [ ] re-architecture a bit so Vectors are generic over containers
//! * [ ] strided iteration over matrices
//! * [ ] windows-function
//!
//! ### 0.X.0
//! * [ ] working SIMD on Vectors (blocked on rust compiler bug(s), but auto-vectorization works
//! super well)
//! * [ ] additional operations on Vectors and Matrixes (taking feature requests!)
//!
//!
//! ### 0.X.0
//! * [ ] interaction with dynamically sized vectors
//!     * [ ] widows-function on dynamically sized vectors
//!
//! ### 0.X.0
//! * [ ] multi-threading for really large workloads
//!
//! ### 0.X.0
//! * [ ] full specialized SIMD for sse, avx and avx512
//! * [ ] full SIMD between Vectors, dynamic Vectors and vector views
//!
//! ### 0.X.0
//! * [ ] a BLAS compatible interface, including a C-interface. Probably in a different crate based
//! on this
//! * [ ] have 2 additional contributors :) come join the fun and headache about weird compiler bugs
//! and pointer offset calculations
//!
//! ### 1.0.0
//! * [ ] been used/tested in other peoples crates and considered usable
//!
//!
//! ## Ideas section
//!
//! Currently the crate is built up from vectors, could instead be built "down" from dimensions
//! see the (private) dimensional module for a sketch of that. its currently blocked on rust not
//! being able to actually use any calculations for const-generic array sizes.
//! positive: enable easier iteration/strided iteration as that would just be plain pointer maths.
//! negative: harder/impossible to express explicit simd.
//!
//!
//! Automatically build Vectors to be ready for simd and/or multiprocessing. also blocked on
//! the same rust feature of calculated array sizes. see the (private) layout module for a preview.
//! im not sure this is necessary though, seeing that with the sizes know at compile time rust
//! generates very good simd and unrolls.
//! positive: perfect simd every time on every platform. negative: higher workload, need to take
//! care for every operation and every platform. negative: transposed and strided iteration gets
//! harder
//!
//! For interoperability it would be nice to express things either being sized or unsized.
//! especially for dimensions like matrix multiplication, U x S(3) * S(3) x U = U x U could be a
//! common case to self multiply a list with unknown number of entries but known number of features
//! (this is probably also blocked on the same rust bug, but i did not test yet)
